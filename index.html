    <h3>For my final project, I decided to reinterpret the audio from a Jak and Daxter gameplay video.  The video shows game protagonist Jak making his way through the level to reach a boss fight against a giant monster at the top of a cliff. I chose this clip because of the variety of sounds Jak would hear on his journey. There are many natural sounds such as waterfalls, fire and thunder as well as artificial sounds like motors, lasers, monster roars. My project focuses on the sounds made by the character and the environment, using audio files from the internet as well as foley sounds and dialogue created by me.</h3>
    <h3>I started the project by first gathering the environmental sounds starting with rain and thunder since they were a constant throughout the entire video. I then added other natural sounds such as fire and waterfalls, followed by artificial sounds such as the laser and robotic arm. I ended with sounds that Jak would make as he traversed the level because of all the audio mapping that had to be done for his jumps, steps and grunts. The sound effects were modified in reaper in order to fit the environment such as the walking on stone audio where I used the ReaXcomp to make the sound flat like when walking on flat stone. When I couldnâ€™t find sounds from the internet, I created my own such as the subtle splashing noise when Jak lands on a floating plank. This was created by sinking a board into a bathtub and changing the pitch to make it sound deeper. I also did all the voice acting for Jak as he made his way through the level.
