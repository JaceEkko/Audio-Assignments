    <p style="font-size: 5vmin">For my final project, I decided to reinterpret the audio from a Jak and Daxter gameplay video.  The video shows game protagonist Jak making his way through the level to reach a boss fight against a giant monster at the top of a cliff. I chose this clip because of the variety of sounds Jak would hear on his journey. There are many natural sounds such as waterfalls, fire and thunder, as well as artificial sounds like motors, lasers and monster roars. My project focuses on the sounds, made by the character and the environment, using audio files from the internet as well as foley sounds and dialogue created by me.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 5vmin">I started the project by first gathering the environmental sounds starting with rain and thunder since they were a constant throughout the entire video. I then added other natural sounds such as fire and waterfalls, followed by artificial sounds produced by the laser and robotic arm. The leveling of these environmental sounds were optimized before the character’s individual sounds were added.  The optimization included adjustment to the volume envelope as the character approached the sound generators. For the monster, Reverb was used for the its roar and movements.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 5vmin">Lastly, Jak’s jumps, steps and grunts were synchronized in Reaper to his movement through the level.  Markers were extensively used for timing all the movements and corresponding sounds. Some sound effects, such as walking on stone, were modified using the ReaXcomp to decrease the attack. Where I couldn’t find sounds from the internet, I created my own, such as the subtle splashing noise when Jak lands on a floating plank. This effect was created by sinking a board into a water-filled bathtub and changing the pitch to make it sound deeper. I also did all the voice acting for Jak as he made his way through the level.
